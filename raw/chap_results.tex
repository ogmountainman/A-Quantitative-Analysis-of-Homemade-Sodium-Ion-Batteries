\newpage
    
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:anodecathodepairing}, a thick titanium-dioxide layer effectively outperforms a thinner layer both in terms of the charged to discharged voltage difference and the peak discharge current.
The thin-layered cathode achieves a charged to discharged difference of $\Delta_{\text{thin}} = \SI{0.1}{\V} - \SI{0.025}{\V} = \SI{0.075}{\V}$ compared to the $\Delta_{\text{thick}} = \SI{0.5}{\V} - \SI{0.025}{\V} = \SI{0.475}{\V}$ charged to discharged delta presented by the thick-layered cathode.

In terms of peak discharge current, the thick-layered cathode outperforms the thin-layered cathode by a factor of four. However, as visible in Fig. \ref{fig:degradedelectrodes} (c) a thicker layer of titanium-dioxide is prone to cracks and disconnect from the FTO current collector. This leads to faster cathode degradation, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:degradedelectrodes} (b). After just a few discharge cycles, a large part of the titanium-dioxide coating has fallen off, and the cathode is burnt. 
However, a thinner titanium-dioxide layer offers less sodium-ion storage. This can be seen through the difference in color intensity between a charged, thin titanium-dioxide coating and a charged, thick coating in Fig. \ref{fig:chargedchathodes}. The thick-layered cathode (a) is visibly more blue than the thin-layered cathode (b), which indicates a higher quantity  of intercalated sodium-ions.
Furthermore, as visible in Figs. \ref{fig:anodecathodepairing} and \ref{fig:degradedelectrodes} (a), soot as an anode substance is not compatible with a water-based electrolyte, as it suspends in the aqueous solution and detaches from the FTO glass slide.

The discharge curves obtained do not resemble those produced by commercially available batteries, since no rated voltage is held over a longer period \cite{Panasonic2018}. Instead, both the voltage and current discharge curves decline rapidly. 
As can be expected through the relationship between current, voltage and resistance: $\mathrm{U}=\mathrm{R} \cdot \mathrm{I}$ and as visible through the grey and green curves in Fig. \ref{fig:dischargecurves}, a lower load resistance of \SI{1e2}{\ohm} compared to \SI{1e3}{\ohm} results in a lower voltage curve overall.
Counterintuitively, the corresponding current curves similarly dropped overall, instead of increasing.
Furthermore, a longer charging period seems to impact battery 1, but not battery 2, as displayed by the generally higher orange curve compared to the more average brown curve in Fig. \ref{fig:dischargecurves}.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
The capacity of the batteries can be determined by integrating the current discharge curves and calculating the area under the curve, as described in equation \ref{eq:capacityequation} and demonstrated in equation \ref{eq:capacityexample}. The integral was numerically approximated using the midpoint rule and a discretization time-step $\Delta t = t_i - t_{i-1} = \SI{1}{\second}$\cite{Kammer2019}.

\begin{align}\label{eq:capacityexample}
    Q &= \int_0^T I \cdot t \cdot d t \approx \sum_{i=1}^{T} \frac{I_i + I_{i-1}}{2} \cdot (t_{i}-t_{i-1}) \Rightarrow Q = \SI{1.92e-2}{\coulomb} \quad \text{duration } T = \SI{600}{\second}\\
    Q &= \SI{5.33e-3}{\mA\hour}
\end{align}


Additionally , the average power output can be calculated, by multiplying the average current by the average voltage. As mentioned in equation \ref{eq:powerequation} and demonstrated in equation \ref{eq:powerexample}.

\begin{align}\label{eq:powerexample}
    I_\text{average} &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} I_i \Rightarrow I_\text{average} = \SI{3.19e-5}{\ampere} \quad \text{duration } n = \SI{600}{\second}\\
    U_\text{average} &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} U_i \Rightarrow U_\text{average} = \SI{3.14e-3}{\volt} \quad \text{duration } n = \SI{600}{\second}\\
    P_\text{average} &= I_{\text{average}} \cdot  U_\text{average} = \SI{3.2e-5}{\ampere} \cdot \SI{3.14e-3}{\volt} = \SI{1.00e-3}{\watt}\\
\end{align}

All calculations were done in Microsoft Excel and can be verified online\cite{Hoffman2022}.
