\section{Conclusion}
When regarding the values obtained with a final average capacity of \SI{5.52e-3}{\mA\hour} and \SI{3.18e-3}{\mA\hour} it can be stated with confidence, that home-made sodium-ion batteries are not effective and viable for modern power requirements. Compared to a state-of-the-art iPhone 14 battery with a capacity of around \SI{3200}{\mA\hour}, the batteries constructed and evaluated throughout this investigation seem insignificant\cite{Miller2022}. Nonetheless, this extended essay provides a comparatively simple construction procedure for basic sodium-ion batteries that could, with a few adaptations, act as the base for an economically viable sodium-ion battery.\\
In conclusion, the initial research question of "To what extent are homemade sodium-ion batteries a viable and effective replacement for modern, state-of-the-art rechargeable batteries?" can be answered by stating, that home-made sodium-ion batteries as described in this investigation are viable only to a small extent and barely effective in replacement modern, state-of-the-art rechargeable batteries. However, they do offer a possible foundation for a future in sodium-ion batteries.
