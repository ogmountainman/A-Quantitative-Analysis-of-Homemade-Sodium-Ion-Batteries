# A-Quantitative-Analysis-of-Homemade-Sodium-Ion-Batteries
The repository holding the plot generation code and raw data for the Extended Essay "A Quantitative Analysis of Homemade Sodium-Ion Batteries".

## How to use
The plots can be generated by cloning the repository and running the jupyter notebook. To successfully create the plots, the following python modules are required:
  1. [jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/)
  2. [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
  3. [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
  4. [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
  5. [seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/)
  6. [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/)

To open the jupyter notebook, simply open a command promt in the clone repository and type `python -m notebook plot_generator.ipynb` and press enter. This should open a jupyter server with the notebook open. To create the graphs, select one code block after the other and press the "run" button on the toolbar. The graphs will be saved as `.eps` files in the `output` directory.
